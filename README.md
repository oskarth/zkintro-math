# zkintro-math

## Setup

Install [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/).

On OSX this can be done with `brew install sage`.

## Examples

To run an example, run it using `sage`. For example, `sage zkboo_add.sage`.

- `commitments_shares.sage` - basic commitments and secret sharing
- `zkboo_add.sage` - basic addition constraint in ZKBoo
- `zkboo_mul.sage` - basic addition and multiplication constraint in ZKBoo

Extending the above to support multiple rounds and making the protocol interactive with Fiat-Shamir is currently left as an exercise for the reader.
